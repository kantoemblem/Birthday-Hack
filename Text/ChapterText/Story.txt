Darling, I know you're excited, but we[N]
reallly don't have to run everywhere.[AN]
The cake isn't going anywhere, is it?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I guess not, but... ugh! I'm just so[N]
excited! It's my special guy's birthday![A]
[OpenFarRight]
We know, darling. You've said it[N]
a dozen times already today.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
And it's been true EVERY TIME! Anyway,[N]

Huh. The cake IS going somewhere. Guess[N]
I was wrong... jeez, that's a first...[A]
[OpenRight]
'Kay but where is my cake.[A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadZanos][ZanosBoop]
Maybe Mimi got to it and ate it all?[AN]
Or, actually, Mimi would've probably[N]
just eaten this massive bag of cotton.[AN]
Which... you keep... in your kitchen...[N]
For... some... reason...? Livvy, what's-[A]
[OpenRight]
WHERE IS MY CAKE.[AN]

Oh, that nasty b-[A]ad guy! She wants[N]
to ruin Ben's birthday! What the heck![A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadZanos][ZanosBoop]
She's, like, some kinda pirate, right?[A]
[OpenRight]
I dunno, she's pretty new to the canon.[AN]
I-I mean, GRRR!!! C'mon, you guys! Let's[N]
gather the others and save Ben's party![A]
[OpenFarRight]
Oh good, more hurrying...[A][X]

## IntroBenSide1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenMidRight][LoadZo][ZoBoop]
... so we'll have to pick up some extra[N]
jobs in the near future, to pay for all[N]
these balloons. We bought... so many...[AN]
As for catering, oh my god, you would[N]
not believe how much these people charge![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ehh, I'll take your word for it. I'm not[N]
the best at this. Thanks for helping, Zo![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hahh... Yeah, it's no problem,[N]
it's just a LOT, you know? At[N]
least it's for a good cause, hehe.[AN]
But... I gotta ask... why are[N]
you practicing swordplay[N]
NOW of all times?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bwahaha! Because evil never sleeps,[N]
and so neither can Justice! Plus it[N]
looks cool and it's actually so fun.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, at least one of us[N]
is having a good time...[A]
[OpenFarRight][TarteBoop]
Ahahahahaaaa! You've got one thing right,[N]
Bringer of Chaos... Evil NEVER sleeps![A][X]

## IntroBenSide2
[OpenLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenFarLeft][LoadZo][ZoBoop][OpenMidRight][LoadTarte][TarteBoop]
That's right! It's your fated archrival![AN]
The dastardly, the conniving, the...[N]
EXTREMELY evil!!! TARTE!!![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Ben who the heck is this.[A]
[OpenLeft]
Oh you wouldn't know her, she's new.[AN]
Ahem! EVILDOER! What wicked plans has[N]
your foul mind cooked up this time!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Wouldn't you just LOVE to know? Sorry,[N]
Ben, but it won't be that easy! Ahahaa![AN]
I'm sure your friends will know sooner[N]
than you... if you know what I mean...[A]
[OpenLeft]
What... You're gonna tell THEM...[N]
and NOT tell me!? You vile fiend![A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, I mean, they're already- I left them[N]
a note when I stole your birthday cake.[A]
[OpenLeft]
What the heck you stole my cake!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ya lol, they're, like, already on the[N]
way. They're gonna, like, find out.[A]
I mean, come face to face! With EVIL![N]
And they will come to know the extent[N]
of my most masterful plan yet! Ahahaa![A]
[OpenLeft]
No!!! You leave my friends alone![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh? You want to save your wimp friends?[N]
Then come, Ben von Arencia... Come, and[N]
face your fate... if you dare... Ahahaa![A][X]

## IntroBenSide3
[OpenMidRight][LoadZo][ZoBoop][OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop]
What the heck! She got everyone else[N]
involved, too... that's a mean thing...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ben! Don't you see how huge a problem[N]
this is!? If everyone else is involved,[N]
then that means our party has no guests![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I mean, aren't you worried they're[N]
in danger? Tarte could hurt them![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Nah, they'll probably steamroll all the[N]
maps. But! The PARTY! What do we do!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I guess you're right... we're the only[N]
ones who can do this. We have to fight.[AN]
Zo, you and I have to save Christmas.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, it's your birthday.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Zo, you and I have to save Birthday.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You'd better... I spent a lot[N]
of gold on this, and I'm not[N]
letting it all go to waste...[A][X]

## Ch1Intro
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop]
Where... the heck...?[AN]
One sec, I was following Tarte's[N]
trail, and the next... gwah???[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadTarte][TarteBoop]
Ahahahahahaaaaa! Livvy, you poor, poor[N]
fool... did you really think you would[N]
find my secret hideout so easily!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Tarte! I don't understand...[N]
What even is this place?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
This is the site of one of your[N]
precious Ben's many embarrassments![AN]
When faced with the overwhelming foe[N]
before him, did he employ his tactical[N]
mind to overcome the challenge? Nay!!![AN]
He relied on sheer luck, rolling the[N]
dice again and again until he won![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What that's so cool omg.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
N-no! Nay! Nuh-uh! It's embarrassing![N]
It's shameful! It's lame and stupid![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't be mean to Ben on his birthday![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Why? Are you gonna stop me? Then come![AN]
Relive this dark chapter of history![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Fine! I will! Jerk! With my FRIENDS!!![AN]
C'mon, everyone! Let's go do whatever[N]
the heck you're doing on this map![AN]
I didn't play this game!!![A][X]

## Ch1Outro
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop][OpenMidRight][LoadTarte][TarteBoop]
Oh you actually won.[AN]
This is a bit awkward.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What are you planning, Tarte!?[N]
Out with it! No more games![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I was kinda planning on you guys giving[N]
up and then, like, kidnapping you to my[N]
lair for the next stage of the plan...[AN]
But now... instead... you'll just have[N]
to FOLLOW ME THERE! Ahahahahaaaaa! Yes![AN]
I'm so cunning and evil, ahahahaaa!!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You're certainly having fun with this...[AN]
So long as you have Ben's cake, I'll[N]
follow you to the ends of the earth![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I-isn't that a bit dramatic?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLivvyMad]
No! I'm gonna KILL YOU!!!!![A]
[OpenMidRight]
U-uhm, f-follow me if you d-dare?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm coming for you, Tarte! AND my cake![A][X]

## Ch2Intro
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop]
Here? I know this place! But... it[N]
looks... different than I remember...[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadTarte][TarteBoop]
Oho, you noticed, did you? Ahahahaaa![AN]
Yes, Ben, remember! Remember, and quake[N]
in your boots in the face of the memory![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I remember... I wasn't really paying[N]
much attention, so things went sideways.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You mean your TERRIBLE TACTICS got your[N]
FRIENDS all BRUTALLY SLAUGHTERED!!!!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, I kinda sucked that day...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But will you still suck as much today?[AN]
I bid you, face the crushing loss you[N]
once underwent, and feel the weight of[N]
your sins crush you into nothingness![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh man... this is serious... but this[N]
time, I've got my friends to help me![AN]
Everyone, we can't let her get away![AN]
After her! And no losses this time!!![A][X]

## Ch2Outro
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenMidRight][LoadTarte][TarteBoop]
Ugh you won too!? How do you guys[N]
just keep winning!? That's no fair![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'm just that cool.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, whatever. Too late now. I'll just[N]
have to... ahem... RETREAT to my SECRET[N]
HIDEOUT to GET AWAY FROM YOU![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
!!![AN]
Hey, wait a sec, guys! If we follow[N]
her, we'll find her lair! Then, she'll[N]
be cornered, with nowhere to run![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Poor, predictable Ben... Catch[N]
me if you can! Ahahahahaaaa!!![A][X]

## Ch3Intro1
[OpenMidRight][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop]
Lava... tall walls... large, gimmicky[N]
layout... Yep, this is Tarte's lair,[N]
no doubt about it! But where is she?[A][X]

## Ch3Intro2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop]
Holy jeez it's scorching in here. Now,[N]
all that's left is to find... LIVVY!?[A][X]

## Ch3Intro3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenMidRight][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop]
Ben! Holy crap holy jeez holy gosh WOW[N]
you will not BELIEVE the day I've had![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I've had a crazy one, too. If you're[N]
here, I think I can guess why, huh?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yeah! Yeah yeah, it was like-[A]
[OpenFarFarRight][TarteBoop]
Ah ah ah, no sappy reunions on MY turf![A][X]

## Ch3Intro4
[OpenLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenFarLeft][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop][OpenMidRight][LoadTarte][TarteBoop]
So, you finally made it. What took you[N]
so long? Got lost in despair on the way[N]
over? Couldn't find the path to victory?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
It was mostly just really hard to swim[N]
across so much lava... really weird[N]
spot to build a house, don'tcha think?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Y-yeah, I mean, I guess you could say[N]
that, if you were, like, freakin, lame[N]
and dumb. It's COOL, okay? It's SO cool![A]
[OpenLeft]
It's pretty cool, babe.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Ugh, yeah, I guess it's pretty cool.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Anyway, whatever! Now that you're here,[N]
you've fallen right into my trap! BEHOLD![A][X]

## Ch3Intro5
[OpenLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenFarLeft][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop][OpenMidRight][LoadTarte][TarteBoop]
How will your precious friends[N]
help you now!? Ahahahahaaaaa!!!!![A]
[OpenLeft]
Crap! We're totally cut off![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
What do we do now!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Nothing! You've been defeated! Now,[N]
the final phase of my plan can be[N]
set in motion! Poor, poor Ben...[AN]
I will make this a birthday to[N]
remember! Ahahahaha! AHAHAHAHAAAAA!!![A]
[OpenLeft]
We're just gonna have to put our faith[N]
in the others one more time. If they[N]
got us this far, they can get us out![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
You're right... We have to trust them.[AN]
You haven't won yet, Tarte! As long as[N]
we have each other, we can fight on!!![A]
[OpenLeft]
Ooh, you're getting better at this![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Hehe, I'm mostly copying you, honestly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Enough! Come at me, both of you! I can[N]
take you both on, just you watch![A][X]

## Ch3Interlude
[OpenLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenFarLeft][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop][OpenMidRight][LoadTarte][TarteBoop]
Wh-what!? You defeated me!? H-how!?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
With the power of friendship! That's how![A]
[OpenLeft]
Okay, that's a little cheesy[N]
even for you, Liv.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Screw off, it's cute![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Heh... Hah! Ahahah! Ahahahahaaaaa!!![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Aw heck she's villain laughing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You FOOLS! This was but a mere SHADE![AN]
My true form awaits behind this door,[N]
in the large, conspicuously boss-fight[N]
shaped room you haven't been in yet![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I knew we were gonna have to go in that[N]
room eventually. I should've seen this[N]
coming! How could I have been so blind?[A]
[OpenLeft]
You... didn't see it coming??[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Come, enter my inner sanctum, and[N]
face my Ultimate Final Trial![AN]
Tarte's Signature Birthday Battle awaits![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
What the heck babe she STOLE my gimmick.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ahaha... I did.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Fuck you.[A]
[OpenLeft]
A-ahem! Evildoer! Nefarious villain![N]
Dastardly fiend! Vile monster! Foul-[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Party crashing hag! Ugly ass-[A]
[OpenLeft]
F-foul ne'er-do-well! We've come to[N]
bring you to justice! Your cake stealing[N]
days are at an end! Prepare to face...[AN]
Ben von Arencia, The Bringer of Chaos![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
And Livvy Something Something,[N]
The Bringer of Love![A]
[OpenLeft]
Let's finish this, in the[N]
name of my birthday![AN]
Chaaaarge!!![A][X]

## Ch3Outro1
[OpenFarRight][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop][OpenMidLeft][LoadTarte][TarteBoop][OpenRight][LoadBen][BenBoop]
Hah... hah... it's over... you lost![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Impossible... my master plan... foiled![A]
[OpenFarRight]
What even was your plan, anyway? To kill[N]
Ben!? On his birthday!?!?!? You jerk![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No... No, nothing like that... Heh,[N]
in fact, I still have one last trick[N]
up my sleeve... aha... ahahaha...[A]
[OpenRight]
Wh-what!?
[OpenFarRight]
Ben, look out! She's got a gun!!![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Wh-what? No, it's not a gun! It's cake![A]
[OpenFarRight]
She's got guncake![A]
[OpenRight]
No, no, Livvy, she's right. That...[N]
doesn't look anything like Livvy's cake.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ahahahaaa! Of course it doesn't! That[N]
pitiful display of a cake is NOTHING[N]
compared to this! Behold, fools![AN]
Tarte's Signature Birthd-[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Call it something else.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
T-Tarte's... Cool Cake Thing.[A]
[OpenRight]
... Was this your plan all along?[AN]
To trick us into coming here so you[N]
could fight us and give us cake?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Awwww! That's sooo cute![A]
[OpenRight]
I thought she was a [OpenQuote]hag"?[A]
[OpenFarRight]
An adorable hag, ehehe![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, yeah, gloat all you like. I knew[N]
Ben would enjoy a big cool duel in a[N]
big cool lava castle, and I... y'know...[AN]
wanted to give him the cake I made...[A]
[OpenRight]
Well, it's a very... nice? looking cake.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
What flavour is it even meant to be...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Cake flavour!!! Look, do you[N]
want the stupid cake or not!?[A]
[OpenRight]
I, Ben von Arencia, will gladly accept[N]
this cake, both as repayment for all the[N]
trouble you caused today... and also,[AN]
as a gift from my dear friend and most[N]
vicious archrival. Does that sound nice?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
... Y-yeah, I guess that's f-fine.[A]
[OpenRight]
Heh. Good! Then it looks like our job[N]
here is done, and justice is served![A][X]

## Ch3Outro2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBen][BenBoop][OpenMidRight][LoadLivvy][LivvyBoop]
Hey Ben~! Got a minute?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Uh, sure, I've got a sec. The party's[N]
just about to start, though, so, y'know.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hehe, I do know. I just wanted to say:[AN]
Happy birthday, Ben. It's been a tough[N]
couple months for you, and I'm so proud[N]
of you! Me, and all your friends here...[AN]
We love you very much! And I can't wait[N]
to celebrate more birthdays yet to come.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Livvy...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah ah ah! The party's about to start, so[N]
you better get yourself out there, yeah?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heh... Bwahahaha! Yes, indeed, my dear[N]
Livvy! 'Tis my sworn duty to bring joy[N]
to my many esteemed guests on this day![AN]
After all, how else should a hero repay[N]
them for all the joy they've already[N]
brought to all of my many days, hmm?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hehe, exactly! What'll you say once you[N]
get out there, hmm? Any big speeches?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nothing toooo big. I'd probably just[N]
say something along the lines of...[AN]
Ahem... Thanks, everyone, for coming to[N]
my big birthday party! It's been a blast[N]
going on this whole adventure with you,[AN]
and we hope you had just as much fun![AN]
Hehe, should we keep pretending we're[N]
not just talking to the audience?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Nah... I think we should just say our[N]
goodbyes and the end the night here![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Right, right, then... thanks for hanging[N]
out everyone. Have a nice night![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Bye bye~! See ya see ya! Nighty nighty![A][X]
